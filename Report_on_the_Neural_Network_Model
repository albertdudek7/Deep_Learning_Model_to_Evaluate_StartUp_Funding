The report should contain the following:

1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  The purpose of the analysis is to determine and select funding for applicants with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
  It is to determine the likelihood and predict the probability that an applicant would be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup.

2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- The target variable for the model is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column. It is the variable that identifies whether the money was used effectively or not.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- All other variables, apart from 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' from application_df were the feature variables of the model. Hence, why 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' was dropped.
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
- 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were both removed from the dataset because they were neither targets nor features.



Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

1.How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - For the initial neural network model I choose to use 10 hidden_node_layers1 and 5 hidden_node_layers2.
  - I used tanh as an activation function for the first hidden layer, relu as the activation function for the second hidden layer and relu for the output layer.
  - The reason I choose 10 and 5 respectively for the hidden_node_layers was it was the number used in some class activities. Similarly, using tanh and relu was found to be accurate in other examples as well. 

2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - I was not able to achieve the target model performance of 75% but was relatively close at 72.3% tested using 20 epochs. 

3. What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
  - I made significant changes to increase model performance. To begin with, I added an additional third hidden layer to the model. 
  - I kept the number of nodes for the first hidden layer the same, but increased the nodes for the second hidden layer to 8 and set the number of nodes for the newly added third layer to 6. 
  - I decided to use a relu activation function instaed of tanh for the first hidden layer, and sigmoid as the activation function for the second, third and output layer. 
  - Lastly, I slightly increased the number of epochs to 25 from 20. This was signicant and interestingly using a higher number of epochs (ie: 40) led to decreased accuracy. 


3. Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.

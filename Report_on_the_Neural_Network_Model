The report should contain the following:

1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  The purpose of the analysis is to determine and select funding for applicants with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
  It is to determine the likelihood and predict the probability that an applicant would be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup.

2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- The target variable for the model is the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column. It is the variable that identifies whether the money was used effectively or not.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- All other variables, apart from 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' from application_df were the feature variables of the model. Hence, why 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' was dropped.
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
- 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were both removed from the dataset because they were neither targets nor features.
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?


3. Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
